My game works by prompting a user with dialogue box containing a story to interact with.

They are given a scenario where they have the opportunity to guess how many roads a llama must walk down in order to get the gold.

  The answer is 13.

If the user guesses too high they will be prompted with a dialogue box that tells them they are guessing too high and to try again.

If the user guesses too low they will be prompted with a dialogue box that tells them they are guessing too low and to try again.

If the user guesses correctly then a dialogue box will inform the user that they have chosen wisely and they are correct.

This game works by using Javascripts: while loops, if and else comparisons, prompts, alerts, variables, and converted strings to intergers with Number.parseInt()

The changes made during pairing was to expand the story offering more choices and adding functions.

when asked why they seek gold a function was created which uses regular expressions to look for specific words namely 'virtue' and 'power'

in addition the answer checker was split off into its own function
