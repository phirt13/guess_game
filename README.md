version//3
This game uses alerts, prompts, if and else, comparisons, and an constructor funtion.

It is story based about a llama who in a search for gold encounters a wise woul.  This soul directs the llama with a riddle to find its gold.  The reward for solving the riddle leaves the player with a sum of gold.

In this version I organized my text into variables in the beginning so that I could see the mechanics of code better.

I also fixed the first if and else comparison and added a constructor function.

During lab time my partners and I mainly worked on gaining a working knowledge of constructors and how to actually apply them to our games.
