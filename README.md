My game works by prompting a user with dialogue box containing a story to interact with.

They are given a scenario where they have the opportunity to guess how many roads a llama must walk down in order to get the gold.

  The answer is 13.

If the user guesses too high they will be prompted with a dialogue box that tells them they are guessing too high and to try again.

If the user guesses too low they will be prompted with a dialogue box that tells them they are guessing too low and to try again.

If the user guesses correctly then a dialogue box will inform the user that they have chosen wisely and they are correct.

This game works by using Javascripts: while loops, if and else comparisons, prompts, alerts, variables, and converted strings to intergers with Number.parseInt()
